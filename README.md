This project is a basic image classification model that uses the MNIST dataset to classify hand-written digits. The model is built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone`
2. Install the required packages:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Running the model: To run the Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the project directory and open the notebook named [`image-classification.ipynb`](image-classification.ipynb) and run the cells in order.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 97.43 % on the test dataset.
